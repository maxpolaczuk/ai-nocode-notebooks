Easy to use Colab notebooks for anyone.

I'm writing a bunch of notebooks so that non-ml developers, product managers, execs etc can play with the latest Gen AI for free on Google Colab. 
My notebooks are very easy to use -- simply click the "open in colab" button and press the `play` icons, then you are away sailing.

My first notebook (LLaVa) has been used to help a PM quickly deploy an image captioning prototype in their product. Hopefully this can unlock more ai POCs for companies.

Upload a picture and ask a LLM anything about it. It is great at describing an image.

I just make everything easy to use, and tidy up the notebooks for convenience. All work is the original authors / researchers.

If my code helps you in your project or business, please let me know :).
